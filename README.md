FPGA_pin_viewer/ contains a collection of scripts to make a graphical representation (HTML+JS) of the FPGA and show what is connected where.

Connector_viewer/ contains some other scripts to make a graphical representation of the Connectors J1-J8, the buffers and the FPGA.

Hello_World_1/ contains a really basic but complete example, from the Verilog-code to the actual programming of the bitstream.

I_want_inputs/ contains a hardware-modification for getting 5V-tolerant inputs.
